# Scrape
Node JS project
Used to scrape data from https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever
I felt that Goodreads website lacks decent book querying tools, so by extracting the data into a spreadsheet program, 
I am better able, to find works I would like to read.

Sample of scraped books here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjTVbhP2dvYPl1cCLYTQudBIA_SKJDZEkBxiTc8tPRw/edit#gid=177070272
